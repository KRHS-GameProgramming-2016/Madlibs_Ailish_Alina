#story()

The *size* *dog breed* trotted along the alleyway, paws hardened after walking along 
hard, brittle surfaces for too long. As *he/she/they if youre obsessed with
gender neutral pronouns* reached the end of their little, private path, bright
lights assaulted their eyes. *gender* always hated emerging onto a bustling sidewalk.
It was always challenging for them to walk down *generic street name* Avenue, they jumped, 
bobbed, and wove between legs. It was like *popular TV show* (preferrably not wipeout or 
american ninja warrior), except that you were little over *super small height that should
not make sense*. Life was a challenge, to say the least.
